Devcon is a cross-platform command line tool running on the JVM that provides many automated tasks around the full life-cycle of Devon applications, from installing the basic working environment and generating a new project, to running a test server and deploying an application to production.

Devcon is the easiest way to use Devon. With a focus on project automation, easy command execution and declarative configuration, it gets out of your way and lets you focus on your code.
